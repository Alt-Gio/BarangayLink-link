3. Run: `npx prisma db push`

### Step 5: Test Deployment
1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Test authentication flow
3. Test API endpoints
4. Test file uploads
5. Test real-time features

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Configuration

### Monitoring Setup
1. Enable Netlify Analytics
2. Configure error tracking
3. Set up uptime monitoring
4. Monitor function execution times

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check for missing dependencies
- Review build logs for specific errors

#### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check if database is accessible from Netlify
- Ensure SSL is enabled for production
- Test connection locally with production URL

#### API Routes Not Working
- Check if @netlify/plugin-nextjs is installed
- Verify redirects in netlify.toml
- Check function timeout settings
- Review function logs

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify Clerk keys are correct
- Check redirect URLs in Clerk dashboard
- Ensure CORS is configured properly
- Test authentication flow

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Test production build
npm run build:netlify

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test database connection
npx prisma db push

# Check Netlify CLI
netlify status
```

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Review environment variables
3. Test locally with production settings
