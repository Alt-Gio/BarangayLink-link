# OneSignal Integration Fixes and Lint Error Corrections

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the OneSignal integration issues and various lint errors in the barangay management system.

## OneSignal Issues Fixed

### Problem
The application was crashing with the error:
```
{imported module [project]/nodemodules/react-onesignal/dist/index.es.js [app-client] (ecmascript)}.default.isPushNotificationsSupported is not a function
```

### Root Cause
The OneSignal API has changed significantly in recent versions, and the implementation was using outdated API methods.

### Solutions Applied

1. **Updated OneSignal Implementation** (`src/lib/onesignal.ts`):
   - Replaced deprecated API methods with current ones
   - Added proper error handling and fallbacks
   - Simplified the initialization process
   - Used correct method names for the current OneSignal version

2. **Enhanced Error Handling** (`src/components/notifications/NotificationProvider.tsx`):
   - Added try-catch blocks around OneSignal operations
   - Implemented graceful degradation when OneSignal fails
   - Added proper state management for error scenarios

3. **Created Test Page** (`src/app/test-onesignal/page.tsx`):
   - Added a dedicated test page to verify OneSignal functionality
   - Provides real-time status updates and debugging information
   - Allows manual testing of notification subscription

## Lint Errors Fixed

### TypeScript/ESLint Issues Corrected

1. **API Routes**:
   - Fixed `any` type usage in `src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`
   - Corrected `any` type usage in `src/app/api/auth/sync-user/route.ts`
   - Fixed `any` type usage in `src/app/api/tasks/route.ts`
   - Fixed `any` type usage in `src/app/api/goals/route.ts`

2. **Schema Corrections**:
   - Removed references to non-existent `department` field in User model
   - Fixed TaskStatus enum usage (`DONE` → `COMPLETED`)
   - Corrected Project field references (`title` → `name`)
   - Fixed relation names (`assignees` → `team` for Project model)

3. **Activity Log Actions**:
   - Fixed invalid activity action (`USER_CREATED` → `CREATED`)

## Key Changes Made

### OneSignal Library (`src/lib/onesignal.ts`)
```typescript
// Before (deprecated API)
await OneSignal.isPushNotificationsSupported();
await OneSignal.setExternalUserId(userId);

// After (current API)
OneSignal.Notifications.isPushSupported();
await OneSignal.login(userId);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Added comprehensive error handling
try {
  await initOneSignal();
  const status = await getSubscriptionStatus();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('OneSignal failed:', error);
  // Graceful fallback
  setPermissionState(prev => ({ 
    ...prev, 
    isLoading: false,
    isSupported: false,
    isSubscribed: false,
    showPrompt: false
  }));
}
```

### Type Safety
```typescript
// Before
let whereClause: any = {};

// After
const whereClause: Record<string, unknown> = {};
```

## Testing

### OneSignal Test Page
Visit `/test-onesignal` to:
- Test OneSignal initialization
- Check subscription status
- Manually trigger notification subscription
- View detailed error messages

### Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=your_onesignal_app_id_here
ONESIGNAL_API_KEY=your_onesignal_api_key_here
```

## Recommendations

1. **OneSignal Setup**:
   - Create a OneSignal account and app
   - Configure the app for web push notifications
   - Add the required environment variables
   - Test the integration using the test page

2. **Development**:
   - Run `npm run lint` regularly to catch new issues
   - Use TypeScript strict mode for better type safety
   - Test OneSignal functionality in different browsers

3. **Production**:
   - Ensure OneSignal is properly configured for production
   - Monitor notification delivery rates
   - Implement proper error logging for OneSignal issues

## Remaining Issues

Some lint warnings remain that are less critical:
- Unused imports and variables
- Missing alt attributes on images
- Unescaped entities in JSX

These can be addressed in future updates as they don't affect functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Test the OneSignal integration thoroughly
2. Configure OneSignal for production use
3. Address remaining lint warnings as needed
4. Monitor the application for any OneSignal-related issues
